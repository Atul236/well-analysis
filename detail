Collected well production, details, field details, and cost data.
Analyzed oil (1000-1500 bpm), gas (500-700 cubic feet/month), and water (200-300 bpm) production.
Found positive correlation between oil & gas (0.98) and negative correlation between water & temperature (-0.45).
Field B had highest oil production (4200 bpm); assessed cost efficiency and noted initial high production with gradual decline.
