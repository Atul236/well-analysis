Collected well production, details, field details, and cost data.
Analyzed oil (1000-1500 bpm), gas (500-700 cubic feet/month), and water (200-300 bpm) production.
Found positive correlation between oil & gas (0.98) and negative correlation between water & temperature (-0.45).
Field B had highest oil production (4200 bpm); assessed cost efficiency and noted initial high production with gradual decline.

Collected well production, well details, field details, and well cost data, including oil, gas, water production, pressure, temperature, depth, drilling cost, completion cost, and operating cost.
Analyzed oil production (1000-1500 bpm), gas production (500-700 cubic feet/month), and water production (200-300 bpm).
Identified positive correlation between oil & gas production (0.98) and negative correlation between water production & temperature (-0.45), with stable monthly production trends.
Compared fields, finding Field B with highest oil production (4200 bpm), and assessed cost efficiency of wells with lower drilling costs achieving significant production, noting initial high production and gradual decline over time.
